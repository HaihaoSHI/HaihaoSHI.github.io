## About Me

I am Haihao SHI, a third-year Master's student in Astrophysics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), jointly trained by Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory and Yunnan Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am currently conducting my research onsite at Yunnan Observatories in Kunming, China, and expect to graduate in 2026.

**I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026 admission.**

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Interpretable Machine Learning** and **Particle Astrophysics**. I am dedicated to developing novel methodological paradigms, aiming to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to address fundamental questions in astrophysics and astronomy. I also enjoy engaging with researchers from diverse disciplines, as I believe such interdisciplinary collaborations can spark insightful and impactful ideas.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), download my [CV](/cv/) or other modules of the website.
