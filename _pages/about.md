## About Me

I am Haihao SHI, a third-year Master's student in Astrophysics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), expecting to graduate in 2026.

**I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026 admission.**

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Interpretable Machine Learning (XAI)** and **Particle Astrophysics**. I am dedicated to developing novel methodological paradigms, aiming to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to address fundamental questions in astrophysics.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publications/), [portfolio](/portfolio/), or download my [CV](/cv/).
